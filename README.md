# The So-So Library
The library where you probably could find the book you want, not always.

## How to use
### v0.1
- First login as admin with username = admin, and password = admin123
- After login as admin you can add book by inserting book data such as book title, and the author name. Here add as many book as you like
- With all the book now showed on the table we can now login as member, but first don't choose login, register first by inserting your name, username, and password
- Only after registering you can login as member with your username and password.
- As we are on the member menu now we can choose to borrow book, try choosing the book by inserting the index as shown on the table.
- After someone borrow a book the status is now changed to "Borrowed" meaning no one can borrow the book unless the one who borrowed it return it first.
- If the borrowed book has been returned we the borrowing data will be removed from the borrow list and the status would be changed to "Available" again.
- If you late on returning the book it will changed the status to "Late", make sure don't be late to return the book
- In case you already finished with the book before the due date, you could returned it and it will immediately changed to "Available" state again
- And that's all from this version, from here i planned to use javafx to make simple ui and use mysql to store the data.
